        <p>Do you need to take advantage of old and new technologies. We can provide feed and gateways to the database into your business services or mainframe. Or if you are in a another country or state then why not consider running your own server in our global farm. Carrier Network Licence's are available.</p>
        <p>Ever heard of EDI, PNL or RFID. Well we are completely briefed by the companies developing these new security enhancements. </p>
        <p>Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is a document standard developed by General Motors many years ago for the shipping industry. And is used to communicate between sites, warehouses and suppliers. The nexus can interact with our associates tools and packages for EDI. If you wondering what EDI is or how talk to Tony Ralph from <a href="http://www.editech.com.au/">EDITech Pty Ltd </a>he will be able to help you with any enquiry you have with this networking standard.</p>
        <p>Programmable Network Layers (PNL) is the new security and shrinkage prevention method developed by <a href="http://www.cisco.com.au/">CISCO</a>. This fantastic bidding and ticket system will be merged into existing network layers on the internet to remove user configuration and network programming. It will all be done at the point of sale and the internet will program the device when you plug it in at home or in the office. This will mean that without purchase things such as ADSL modems and other Internet complaint devices through a PNL terminal then it will not work as the Internet will need to be told about the new device on your network.</p>
        <p>Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID) tagging is the new concept for Pick and Pack, as well as warehouse environment. It will ensure that your pallets will vocally/display there designation for shipping as well as the items themselves being radio tagged so without going our your dock will notify the network that it is being removed without authorisation. This new technology will reduce shrinkage by at least 10 fold. </p>
        <p>Not only can you support a full customizable stationary set for your clients to receive by mail but you also are able to track and audit any transaction in the system. </p>
        <p>It is as easy as registering your sysop account online which will give you a bonus level in the forum and choosing Option 2 of the New Account Wizard. This will allow you to setup and establish a private business reality within the nexus and using the NSCE you can start by creating your services tree and listing your products as templates.</p>

However when you reach a customer count of your specification the you will start to be charged your specified administration and maintenance fee.

Quite soon we will be looking at developing plug-in options using class referential linking so you can make your own developed plug-in for the environment. So if you are using some PNL stuff that is not CISCO it will still interact with the software. </p>

        Well that's right everyone since the advent of .NET 2003 all that bugginess in there new compilers and framework is gone. So move over VIsual Studio 6.0 ENT, because we are in the process of entirely restructuring the internal and making a .NET naming conventions and compliantancy to both editions. </p>
      <p align="justify">The conversion between old naming conventions and system to produce to new totally ActiveX Complaint version of MOST will ensure there will never be any compatibility problems. This will even mean we can make MOST (p-code) version complaint all the way back as far as VB60ENT will let us. And have a new hybrid version for microsoft of today and tomorrow. The <strong>Fold over</strong> between the compilers is termed to take awhile. </p>
      <p align="justify">To do a fold over it basically mean a total rewrite of the internal, GUI, some extra database parameters making new ActiveX controls and DLL to be used as plug-ins with the Microsoft ActiveX Plug in OCX and its referencing systems.</p>
      <p align="justify">Once all the components are in place we will be moving the beta system over to first release which will include a full banking system already running into the system. All you have to do is put your account details in and as a business the transactions are billed consistency on one document that is exchanged inside the platform. This Money In, Money Out insure that whether you want to have your profit either before vendor or after depending on what you want.</p>
      <p align="justify">The money is automatic deducted and then on the same process in the bank - transfer into your account. You can have this as a trickle or set spill level for when you want the monies to be deposit when incurring to a total sum of inside the system.</p>
      <p align="justify">This is a document very similar to EDI from general motors. And will ensure your direct debits whether they be in accounts in Australia or through the SWIFT code then you will be able to even ensure your customer safety by locking details etc.</p>
      <p align="justify">In an recent overview of the banking system we have finalized our research on, it was comment as follows: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify"><em>&quot;Part of initial analyses of a major transaction system with this likes, is not so much can we or where do I store the users critical data like credit card or account numbers. It is not even if you can use reversible cryptology. The best system I can see is not having the numbers at all. In other words at point of contact with the customer their details along with our merchant details and their business detail are turned into a none reversible checksum, md5 would be fine as the details would be longer than 32chars. </em></p>
        <p align="justify"><em>This checksum is unique to that business that is billing the client, this means in a appendix number system in the bank which only receives these checksums from The Nexus. The billing process make a comparison the checksum to the one the bank  was sent on the point of collection in the nexus systems and then subsequently the process of monies and transaction are done in the next tier out from this cluster data. This means there is a 0% percentile in marginal error or cross referencing between system in remote auditing system that banks would have access to.</em></p>
        <p align="justify"><em>The only other draw back is malicious use or number skimming, to ensure for this we are currently negotiation with Baycorp Advantage about allow Business Network Providers with the ability through here to prepare and submit bad credit reports and enquire on people ability to purchase goods on credit system's or just generally with them. Also ensuring that any 'known alias' in the billing world throughout 1000's of corporations credit assessments and poor credit information will also be here in the nexus with your extra baycorp subscription ensuring that you keep both The Nexus and the External Affiliates of Baycorp Advantage safe from fraudulent and malicious use of there business systems and processes. This will hopefully be cheaper than registering with them directly as there is very little work they have to do, hey they don't really even have to bill it. All they have to do is activate your account when the payment reaches their accounts. And Credit assessing you go.&quot;</em></p>
