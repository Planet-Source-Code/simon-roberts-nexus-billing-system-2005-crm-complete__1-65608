			<Char_Desc_250>Alphanumeric to Trigrams [ANTdb 2005] is the forefront of fractal text analyse and encryption; It will display the physical compass map of sentences you enter we call this a datamap, charts and statistics on any language you enter into the array.</Char_Desc_250>
			<Char_Desc_450>ANTdb is a powerful chaos analyzer, you can use it for a wide variety of tasks. Such as DNA pattern matching and text analyses. It will produce a graphical result consisting of multi-layered trigrams. You can load as many lattices as you want and the options for processes of analyses are built into the control panel. 

There are built in chaos robot that will duty cycle and lattice randomise your arrays of charts. You also can adjust typeset</Char_Desc_450>
			<Char_Desc_2000>ANTdb is a powerful chaos analyzer, you can use it for a wide variety of tasks. Such as DNA pattern matching and text analyses. It will produce a graphical result consisting of multi-layered trigrams. You can load as many lattices as you want and the options for processes of analyses are built into the control panel. 

There are built in chaos robot that will duty cycle and lattice randomise your arrays of charts. You can also adjust the order of elements used for different type of typeset. 

A trigram consist of 6 horizontal lines that are either broken or joined. This is also seen as Yin and Yang. While exploring this strange language developed by the chinese, 5000 years ago. We also discovered a very effective encryption formula that we have done a file encryption example of for your enjoyment. This type of encryption was dubbed NRG because of the way it changes the signals of electricity inside the byte array. Mixing and matching bits.

The humble trigram is dived up into a couple of different types of elements that ANTdb reports statistics on. These are the Elements and the Nuclear. Each consisting of different parts of the whole trigram. The order of the element appearing above an (8,8) array is one of the 3 keys in NRG encryption.

If you wanted to write this into a port to port tcp/ip connection you would be able to cycle the keys with a divinan handshake between the clients, this would product high grade military encryption well over 4KBits. Anything is possible with NRG it is like a 6 bit joggle dial per byte, spin that wheel. This is possibly the worlds first Fractal Based Encryption set. 

Anyway I hope this little explanation will provide you with enough details to have a look at this fancy little app. It also has a built in message board for MySQL servers. We have just started a divination component into ant, this is exspected to be released in a couple of months, after we have finished building the matrix. *** DIVINTATION NEXT VERSION ***</Char_Desc_2000>
