      <p>It not the first time society has heard of Exitstencil Press as it is an organization that exists in other countries as well. Exitstencil Press Started as a freedom of speech and expression in the UK back just before 1972 and has existed in the UK ever since. They consisted mainly of artists and musicians and produced some of societies greatest teaching in musical literature. Exitstencil Press UK also diversified over a number of years into Art and Auctions, Live performances, poetry and spoken word and written testimony of life in the ever increasing pace of modern society.</p>
      <p>Quiet quickly their school of thought and philosophy spread through the far reaches of the united kingdom, including other country not contained within this monarchy. One of these band who no longer perform where know as Crass. Now days the artist of crass have a different motive Jazz, education, and appreciation of the environment they had created for themselves. And I must say, I agree with them that a sofa is hardly a compromise for a bed.</p>
      <p>Much of this literature and sounds are still available for order from your good music retailer but some of the more pressing issue are raised in books written by Exitstencil Press UK which you will be able to order through either the Black rose or any other good bookstore such as borders books.</p>
      <p>In australia much of this movement consists of environmentalists who offern frequent themselves to Wood chipping protests and generally do <em>lock-ons </em>to large machinery. Well we are the other side, IT infrastructure, programmers, Network Engineers, Graphic Designers and so on. The music we listen to has changed over this 38 years as well. We frequently find Electronic Sounds being the medium of expression in this day to day existence of music and the arts with this being intertwined with the distorted electric guitar - <em>we have seen new forms of music be born into this culture.</em></p>

      <p align="justify">Well in Australia there is a small group of traditionalist but we like to be responsible citizens of our country and have our organizations/companies/charities registered with the appropriate governing body. This allows for more a flexible and dynamic opportunities for us to excel in producing long standing business relationship with companies, political groups, business and of course the IT Industry. Without that registration everything is null and void.</p>
      <p align="justify">Exitstencil Press Pty ltd was founded in Australia May 2001. This was registers as a private sector body that had interests in science. Primarily IT Technology's and Telecommunications. It soon exploded in the EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) doing trade within it first year with Tony Ralph from EDItech Pty Ltd. This long standing relationship between the Director (Simon) and Tony, allow for expansion into ordering systems and data networks from and early age. The Director at this stage had developed EDItech's original EDI Parser. Not much else happened this year until the second Director (Jarrett) joined the company.      </p>
